## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sector rotation is the movement of money from one sector to another as economic conditions change. Top traders use a combination of:

1. **Relative Strength Analysis** (most common)
2. **Economic Cycle Phase Detection**
3. **Visual Tools** (RRG charts, heat maps)
4. **Ratio Charts** (defensive vs cyclical)

## THE FOUR TOOLS FOR SPOTTING ROTATION EARLY

From [StockCharts (Feb 2025)](https://articles.stockcharts.com/article/articles-chartwatchers-2025-02-sector-rotation-how-to-spot-it-275/):

### 1. RRG (Relative Rotation Graph)

**What it is:** A visualization showing how sectors move relative to a benchmark (usually S&P 500).

**How to read it:**
- **Leading quadrant (top-right):** Sectors with strong momentum AND relative strength
- **Weakening quadrant (bottom-right):** Strong but losing momentum
- **Lagging quadrant (bottom-left):** Weak momentum AND relative strength
- **Improving quadrant (top-left):** Weak but gaining momentum

**Action:** Buy sectors moving from Improving → Leading. Sell sectors moving from Weakening → Lagging.

### 2. MarketCarpets (Heat Maps)

**What it is:** Visual display of sector performance as colored tiles.

**How to use:**
- Green = outperforming
- Red = underperforming
- Size = market cap weight

**Action:** Look for clusters of green in one sector while others are red → rotation signal.

### 3. Bullish Percent Index (BPI)

**What it is:** Percentage of stocks in a sector with Point & Figure buy signals.

**Interpretation:**
- BPI > 70%: Overbought (sector likely to rotate out)
- BPI 50-70%: Bullish, favor this sector
- BPI 30-50%: Bearish, avoid this sector
- BPI < 30%: Oversold (potential rotation target)

**Action:** When BPI crosses above 50 from below → sector is strengthening.

### 4. Ratio Charts (SPLV:MTUM)

**What it is:** Compare defensive ETF (SPLV) vs cyclical ETF (MTUM).

**Interpretation:**
- SPLV:MTUM rising → Money moving to defensive (risk-off)
- SPLV:MTUM falling → Money moving to cyclical (risk-on)

**Action:** Use as confirmation of broader rotation patterns.

## SECTOR ETF PROXIES

## PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### How to Use This Information

1. **Determine Current Cycle Phase**
   - Check GDP trend, unemployment, inflation
   - Identify if early, mid, late, or recession

2. **Review Relative Strength**
   - Which sectors outperforming S&P 500?
   - Consistent leaders or new rotation?

3. **Confirm with Technical Tools**
   - RRG chart shows rotation direction
   - BPI confirms breadth

4. **Align with Our System**
   - If sector rotating IN → prioritize stocks from that sector
   - If sector rotating OUT → avoid or reduce exposure

### Integration with Swing Trade Analyzer

**Current State:** We scan all sectors equally.

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Add sector filter to scanner
- Weight stocks by sector strength
- Show sector rotation dashboard

**Deferred for v2:** This adds complexity. Focus on core system first.

## WHAT TOP TRADERS DO DIFFERENTLY

1. **They Don't Chase Yesterday's Leaders**
   - Look for sectors ENTERING leadership, not already there
   - RRG "Improving" quadrant is key

2. **They Use Multiple Timeframes**
   - Weekly for rotation direction
   - Daily for entry timing
   - Monthly for cycle phase

3. **They Limit Rotations**
   - 4-6 major rotations per year maximum
   - Don't react to every weekly fluctuation

4. **They Start Small**
   - Allocate 20-30% to rotation strategy
   - Keep core holdings stable

5. **They Wait for Confirmation**
   - Multiple signals before rotating
   - Not just one indicator

## TOOLS WE COULD USE

### Free Tools

| Tool | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| StockCharts RRG | stockcharts.com | Rotation visualization |
| Finviz Sector Map | finviz.com/map.ashx | Heat map |
| TradingView Sectors | tradingview.com | Sector performance |
| SPDR Sector Tracker | sectorspdrs.com | ETF comparison |

### Data We Already Have

| Data Point | Source | Can Use For |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| SPY trend | yfinance | Market regime |
| VIX level | yfinance | Risk assessment |
| Sector of each stock | yfinance info | Sector filtering |
| Relative Strength | We calculate | Stock vs SPY |

### Data We Would Need

| Data Point | Source | Complexity |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Sector BPI | StockCharts | Would need to calculate |
| RRG data | StockCharts | API not available |
| Sector RS rankings | yfinance | Can calculate |

---

## CONCLUSION

**For our current system:**

Sector rotation is valuable context but adds significant complexity. Our current approach of:
- Market regime filter (SPY > 200-EMA)
- Relative strength vs SPY
- Volume confirmation

...already captures some rotation effects implicitly.

**If we wanted to add sector awareness:**

1. **Simple:** Show sector of selected stock + 1-month sector performance
2. **Moderate:** Filter scanner by top 3 performing sectors
3. **Complex:** Full RRG-style rotation dashboard

**Recommendation:** Add "Simple" level in v2. Complex rotation tools are nice-to-have but not essential for swing trading success.
